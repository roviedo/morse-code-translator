#### Simple Morse code translator React app

### This app translates the dots and dash to words and you can also play the morse code.
Note: this is playing the dot and dash sounds respectively but not how it would actually sound, as in real life scenario this will have a more continuous sound, this would need a backend to put together the dots and dashes and generate one audio morse code.


### How to run this app

```
cd /path/to/morse-code-translator
npm install
npm start
```
