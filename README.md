### Simple Morse code translator React app

#### This app translates the dots and dashes to words and you can also play the morse code.
Note: This app is plays the dots and dash sounds respectively but not how it would actually sound in real life scenario, this will have a more continuous sound, this would need a backend to put together the dots and dashes and generate one audio morse code. This is all proof of concept.

### How to run this app

```
cd /path/to/morse-code-translator
npm install
npm start
Go to your favorite browser http://localhost:3000
```
